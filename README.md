# Bank_Churn_Predictor

The main purpose of this project is to create a deep learning model to predict whether a customer will continue their bank service to leave it. The highlight of this project is the intense data pre-processing before the model creation: the large imbalance  between the number of training samples in each class. The imbalance is dealt is in multiple ways: under sampling, the majority class, oversampling the minor class using duplication and SMOTE. For each method, a model is created and classification report is made on each model and compared.
